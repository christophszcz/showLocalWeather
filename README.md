## Show The Local Weather

Up to the minute weather conditions are displayed based off of the user's current location. The ip-api.com geolocation API extracted the user's whereabouts, meanwhile the Open Weather API used this information to display corresponding weather data. You can also toggle between metric and imperial units.
